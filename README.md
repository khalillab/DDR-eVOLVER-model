**eVOLVER:**
1) DDR64: Scripts and real-time generated data from DDR64 experiment
2) DDRWO: Scripts and real-time generated data from DDR Washout experiment
NOTE: While functional, these scripts are out of date, and current versions of eVOLVER code should be accessed at https://github.com/FYNCH-BIO

**Simulation Code:**

3) DDR_Simulator: Monod consumer resource, linear consumer resource, and lotka volterra simulations contained in Jupyter Notebook
